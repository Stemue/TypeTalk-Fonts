# TypeTalk Fonts
TypeTalk fonts utilize the OpenType font format to replace different word combinations, grammatical elements, and vocabulary variations based on speech patterns. The fonts take on their own personalities and behaviors, creating a relationship between the formal elements of handwriting and the contextual variants of language.
