# TypeTalk Fonts
TypeTalk fonts utilize the OpenType font format to replace different word combinations, grammatical elements, and vocabulary variations based on speech patterns. The fonts take on their own personalities and behaviors, creating a relationship between the formal elements of handwriting and the contextual variants of language.

This project was my MFA thesis in 2005. I was experimenting with using OT features to express speech patterns in a font. This was not intended to release more terrible handwriting fonts into the world. Instead, it was (and is) a way of demonstrating the potential possibilities of “intelligent” font formats.
